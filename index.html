		 <h1>Web design as architecture</h1>
	 </header>
	 <ol>
	 	<li><span>Websites are places.</span> They provide services, they serve and frame content. Watching a video on <a href="https://nowness.com">Nowness</a> is different from watching a video on YouTube. Buying an onigiri from a 7-11 branch is different from buying a buttered pretzel from a Bavarian bakery. There may be a digital equivalent to the Zumthorian Atmosphere.</li>
	 	<li><span>Websites are inherently public.</span> In similar ways, architecture is by nature a public discipline. Buildings and websites are <i>built realities</i>. They become part of the fabric of a world that is now both physical and virtual.</li>
	 	<li><span>Websites are inhabited.</span> They become part of society through the interactions they enable. They are homes to communities, to thoughts and approaches. Many websites are privately owned and operated, but inhabited and used by the public. As buildings, website are where we spend our lives.</li>
	 	<li><span>Websites are constructed.</span> Relevant websites may use new material or existing materials to new effect. They may employ new ways of construction, or cite old ways of construction. Similarly, material and construction are defining characteristics of every architectural work.</li>
	 	<li><span>Websites are cultural artifacts.</span> Like buildings, websites foster aesthetic and social dialogues. They do so by establishing new ways of social interaction or by initiating new aesthetic discourses.</li>
	 	<li><span>Websites age.</span> As buildings, some get better with age, some decay, some may get repaired.</li>
	 	<li><span>Websites are local,</span> despite their distributed nature. Websites adhere to culturally established patterns, languages and user expectations in similar ways architecture does. Even when disregarding language barriers, there are substantial differences between East Asian and European buildings.</li>
	 	<li><span>Websites exist within frameworks</span> and negotiate complex requirements. Similarly, architecture deals with zoning and building regulations. Smart integration or avoidance of such requirements may be a source for good and efficient design in both cases.</li>
	 	<li><span>Websites are made by individuals,</span> by collectives or by large-scale project groups. This fundamentally shapes their nature. Similar differences exist between private construction and large-scale urban projects. There is – different – value in each scale.</li>
	 	<li><span>Websites are inevitable.</span> Applying Rem Koolhaas' adage about buildings, a website has to happen in order for a service or content to exist in the digital realm.</li>
	 </ol>
